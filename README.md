# Amazon Seller Fee WebScraper

This webscraper scrapes the rates of Referral Fees, FBA Fulfillment Fees and Storage Fees on this URL https://sell.amazon.com/pricing to keep updated on prices.

How to Use:
1. Download the code and go to the main.
2. Uncomment the fees you want to obtain.
3. Run "python main.py" in terminal

Note: This is the first iteration of this project and there are many improvements to be made.  Feel free to contribute.

Future Improvements To Be Made:
1. More robust way of scraping (Most data is manually acquired then parsed)
2. Tests and checks to see if the hard-coded scrapes and still possible and accurate
3. Converting data to usable type (all data extracted are currently strings including fees)
  a. Parsing data to a cleaner output
